# Commit changes to repo via Visual Studio Code Terminal

```git status``` check branch

```git add .``` full stop to add all changes

```git commit -m initialcommit``` "initialcommit" is the change control description

```git push origin main``` push changes to the "main" branch in your github repository.

```git checkout -b site``` creates a new branch called "site". Make a new branch, then goto github and use pull request to merge with main branch Project: Might not want to serve up the project using the main branch. We might want a web site to accompany the project, not host the project.
