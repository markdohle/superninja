# Commit changes to repo via Visual Studio Code Terminal
```git status``` - check branch
(git add .) - full stop to add all changes
(git commit -m initialcommit) - "initialcommit" is the note
(git push origin main) - push it to the repo
(git checkout -b site) - creates a new branch called "site". Make a new branch, then pull request to merge with main branch.
(git push origin site) - push the branch "site" to the repo.
Project: Might not want to serve up the project using the main branch. We might want a web site to accompany the project, not host the project.
