            <h5>Bio</h5>

            <p>Hello world! My name is Mark Dohle. I work in facilities management at MIT as a Senior Planner for Repair and Maintenance. We have a group of 5 people. We plan the preventative maintenance for 120 buildings with 50,000 infrustructure assets. We inventory, plan and schedule the work for each asset. In order to have a successful program, we need to be able to get massive amounts of information chanelled to the right people at the right time.

            I am happily married with two little kids. I have a small hobby coffee farm and Airbnb in Costa Rica that I manage with my brother and sister. I enjoy reading history, economics, and philosophy.

            I am learning to code because I think it is a requirement for modern life. There is simply too much information process in traditional ways. I need more reach. I want to use the tools to be more efficient at work and I also want to be able to help my children learn when the time comes.
